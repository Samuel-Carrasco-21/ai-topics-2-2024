      "FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is fast, easy to use, and enables developers to create robust web applications and RESTful APIs quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features:\n",
      "1. **Fast**: It is one of the fastest web frameworks available due to its use of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.\n",
      "2. **Pythonic**: It is based on standard Python type hints, making it easy to understand and use.\n",
      "3. **Automatic Validation**: Request payload validation is done automatically using Pydantic, helping ensure that data conforms to expected formats.\n",
      "4. **Interactive API Documentation**: Automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Installation\n",
      "To install FastAPI, use pip:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install fastapi\n",
      "```\n",
      "You’ll also need an ASGI server, like uvicorn, to run the application:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install uvicorn\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Usage Example\n",
      "Here's a simple example of a FastAPI application:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
      "\n",
      "app = FastAPI()\n",
      "\n",
      "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
      "def read_root():\n",
      "    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
      "\n",
      "@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",
      "def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):\n",
      "    return {\"item_id\": item_id, \"q\": q}\n",
      "```\n",
      "### Running the Application\n",
      "To run the application, use the following command:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
      "```\n",
      "### Path Parameters and Query Parameters\n",
      "- **Path Parameters**: Specified in the path and can be referenced directly.\n",
      "- **Query Parameters**: Optional parameters specified in the URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of combination:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",
      "def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):\n",
      "    return {\"item_id\": item_id, \"q\": q}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dependency Injection\n",
      "FastAPI allows for easy dependency injection, providing a way to separate concerns and make your code cleaner and more modular:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from fastapi import Depends\n",
      "\n",
      "def get_query_param(q: str = None):\n",
      "    return q\n",
      "\n",
      "@app.get(\"/items/\")\n",
      "def read_items(query_param: str = Depends(get_query_param)):\n",
      "    return {\"query_param\": query_param}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Validation with Pydantic\n",
      "Define your models with Pydantic for easy data validation:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
      "\n",
      "class Item(BaseModel):\n",
      "    name: str\n",
      "    price: float\n",
      "    is_offer: bool = None\n",
      "\n",
      "@app.post(\"/items/\")\n",
      "def create_item(item: Item):\n",
      "    return item\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Middleware and CORS\n",
      "FastAPI supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and other middleware options easily to handle specific requirements such as API security and user management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "FastAPI is an excellent choice for building APIs due to its speed, ease of use, and features like automatic validation and interactive documentation. By leveraging Python's type hints and Pydantic's power, developers can quickly create robust and maintainable applications.\n",
      "\n",

      "### SciPy Overview\n",
      "SciPy is an open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large collection of mathematical algorithms and functions that operate on NumPy arrays. SciPy is commonly used in various fields such as engineering, science, and mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Installation\n",
      "You can install SciPy using pip:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install scipy\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features\n",
      "1. **Modules**: SciPy contains several modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, and other aspects of scientific computing.\n",
